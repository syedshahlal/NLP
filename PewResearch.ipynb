The parties agree that any breach of the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement by User will result in irreparable damage to the Center for which it will have no adequate remedy at law.  Therefore, it is agreed that the Center shall be entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction enjoining any such breach by any court of competent jurisdiction.  Such injunction shall be without prejudice to any other right or remedy to which the Center may be entitled, including but not limited to any damages resulting from User\\u2019s breach of the confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.  Any failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall not operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\\n\\tC.\\tUser will immediately notify the Center and cooperate with investigations, and provide any information reasonably requested by the Center if User knows of or suspects any breach of security or potential vulnerability of the Data and will promptly remedy such breach.\\n\\n\\tIV.\\tIndemnification. User shall indemnify and hold harmless the Center, its affiliates and related organizations, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, legal representatives, agents, successors and assigns, from and against any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\\u2019 and professionals\\u2019 fees and court costs arising out of any third-party claims based on (a) User\\u2019s access or use of the Data; (b) any changes made by User to the Data in accordance with this Agreement; or (c) any breach by User of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\\n\\n\\tV.\\tTermination.
